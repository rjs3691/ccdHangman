# ccdHangman
Hangman game for a Sunday School Class

# Requirements
  - Python 3.6
  - NumPy
  - Pygame
  
# Note on Distribution
I would like to distribute this as an .Exe, but py2Exe currently does not work with Python 3.6 as of Jan 11/12th 2017. For now, you'll need to download the source, install the requirements if you haven't, then run it using Python.
